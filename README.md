# Python-Loops-for-Big-SQL

#sometimes we got sql codes that cannot be run at one time because it pulls so many data. In this case, we can split the time, run it in every sub sections, and insert it into formal table using a py.

#I write an example of that py and I put the sql codes here only as an example. The sql codes is faked.

#good luck with your no-more-spooling-space : )
